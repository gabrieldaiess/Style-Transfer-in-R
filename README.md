# Style-Transfer-in-R
This project is a spin on the classic Style Transfer project done by Gatys et al. For my variation I used the VGG19 model architecture in TensforFlow but wrote out the code from scratch in R. 
I chose to do it this way as it would give me a better grasp on how to build NNs in R whereas most prefer Python.
